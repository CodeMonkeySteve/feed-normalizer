
1.2.0

 * Added HtmlCleaner - sanitizes HTML and removes 'bad' URIs to a level suitable
   for 'safe' display inside a web browser. Can be used as a standalone library,
   or as part of the Feed object. See Feed.clean! for details about cleaning a
   Feed instance. Also see HtmlCleaner and its unit tests. Uses Hpricot.
 * Added Feed-diffing. Differences between two feeds can be displayed using
   Feed.diff. Works nicely with YAML for a readable diff.
 * FeedNormalizer.parse now takes a hash for its arguments.
 * Removed FN::Content.
 * Now uses Hoe!
